# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candiates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:

- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette

## Challenge Overview
This challenge tested our ability to understand basic Python concepts, including using variables to load and save files, opening our file using the election data, and printing our results to another text file. We also put our knowledge of lists, dictionaries, for loops, if statements, and different printing techniques to use.

# Challenge Summary
I have some understanding of Python because I took a class on it several years ago, but this challenge was a good refresher of the basics for me.
